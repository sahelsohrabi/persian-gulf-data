# Persian Gulf Data

## Dataset Overview
This repository contains data of the Persian Gulf, obtained from the **Copernicus Marine Service**, for **26 August 2025**. 
The dataset includes the following variables:

- **thetao**: Potential temperature (Â°C)  
- **so**: Salinity (PSU)  
- **uo, vo**: Surface current components (m/s)  
- **zos**: Sea surface height (m)  
- **siconc, sithick, usi, vsi**: Sea ice concentration, thickness, and ice currents  
- **bottomT, mlotst**: Bottom temperature and mixed layer thickness  

Dimensions: `time:1, latitude:73, longitude:144, depth:1`
